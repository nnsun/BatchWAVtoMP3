# What it does

BatchWAVtoMP3 prompts for a folder path and encodes all uncompressed \*.wav files in the directory to 128 kbps \*.mp3 files. The \*.wav files are then deleted.

# Getting Started

This program uses the [LAME MP3 encoder](http://lame.sourceforge.net/index.php). To run, simply download lame.exe from [here](http://www.rarewares.org/mp3-lame-bundle.php). Either add the lame directory to your Path environment variables or move lame.exe to execution directory.
